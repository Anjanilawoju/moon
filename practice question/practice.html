-what is css. different types of css
Css stands as Cascading Style Sheet 
Css is a language that is used to style the HTML
it discribes  how HTML elements should be displayed  on a web page, including their layout, colors, fonts and other visual aspects
it allow web developer to seperate the structure and content of a document from its virtual presentation 

Key features 
Selector 
properties
values
Box model

Different types of Css??
common types of css are 
Inline css
inline css is applied  directly within the HTML document using the style attribute on individual Html elements
it has the highest specificity and overrides other styles 
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">this is the inline style.</p>

Internal CSS
It is defined within the HTML document using  the style tag in the head section.
it applies styles to the entire document 
<head>
    <style>
        body{
            background-color: aliceblue;
            font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
        }
    </style>
</head>

External CSS
is stored in a seperate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the link tag. 
it allows for the centralization of style and is commonly used for maintaining consistent styles across multiple page
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
body{
    background-color: #fff;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

CSS Framework
are pre-prepared libraries that provide common styles and layouts, helping developers create responsive and consistent design quickly.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">

CSS preprocessors
 are scripting languages that extend  the capabilities of css,
 eg Sass, less. They allow for the use of variables, nesting and function, making CSS more maintainable and modular

 /* Example using Sass syntax */
 $primary-color: #3498db;
 
 body {
     background-color: $primary-color;
 }
 -margin and padding in css
 Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
 CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
 With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

 css has properties for specifying the margins for each side of an element 
 margin-top
 margin-right
 margin-botton
 margin-left

 All marging properties can have the following values:
 auto: the browser calculates the margin
 length: Specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc
 % : specific a margin in % of the width of the containing element 
 inherit: specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element 


 Padding 
 Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

 The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

CSS has a properties 
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

padding properties can have the following values

length: specifies a padding in px, pt,cm etc
%: specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element
inherit: specifies that the padding should be inherited form the parent element

-alert boxes in javascript
use the alert() function to display an alert box with a message to the user.
the alert() function is often used for simple notifications or to get the users attentions
alert("Hello, this is an alert!");
you can also include variables and concatenate strings to create dynamic messages within the alert 
let userName = "John";
alert("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to our website.");

-what is web server and web browser
web server and web browser are two distinct components of the World Wide Web architecture 
each playing a crucial role in the process of retriving and displaying web content 

A web browser is basically the software that we use for browsing on the internet and displaying pages.
A web server refers to the software that provides  its user with the documents they request vis their web browser 
web browser are application programs. They display a www document, and they usually access the document using other internet service


web server is a software application or hardware device that stores, processes, and serves web page and other web content to users over the internet 
it handels incoming  requests from web browser, retrive the requested resources, and sends them back to the browser for display
function 
retrives and processes requested resources listens for and accepts incoming HTTP request from clients send the processed content back to the requesting client. 
For instance:
Services like Amazon S3, google cloud storage 

Web Browser 
A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and navigate the World Wide Web, view web pages and interact with web content
it interprets HTML, CSS and javascript and other  web technologies to render and display web pages 

function
Sends HTTP  request to web servers to retrive web pages and resources 
render HTML and CSS to display the content in a user-friendly format 
executes javascript to enable dynamic and interactive element on web page 
manage user interaction, such as clicking links, submitting forms and handling cookies
for instance
google chrome, Morzilla Firefox, Apple safari

-the role of javascript in web development
javascript is a versatile and essential programming language in web development, playing a crucial role in enhancing the interactivity, responsiveness and overall user experience of website.
javascript is the worlds most popular programming language 
js is the programming language of the web

The role of js in web development
Client-slide Scripting 
is a primarily a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the user's browser.
allows developer to create dynamic and interactive content directly within the user's web browser without the need of constant communication with thw server 

DOM manipulation 
enables manipulationof the Document Object Model, which represents the structure of an HTML document
developers can dynamically modify, add, or remove HTML elements, attributes, and styles to update the content and appearance of a web page in real-time 

Event handling
allows developer to respond to user actions, such as clicks, keypresses and form submissions,
enables the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces
// Example of handling a button click event
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});


Asynchronous programming
supports Asynchronous programming through mechanisms like callback, promises and async/await
essential for handling tasks that may take time, such as fetching data from a server or loading resources, without blocking the main execution thread
// Example using Promises for asynchronous operations
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));


AJAX
facilitates the use of AJAX, allowing for asynchronous communication with servers 
enables the updating of parts of a web page without requiring a full page reload, leading to smoother and more dynamic user experience 
// Example of making an AJAX request using the Fetch API
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));


Form Validation 
is commonly used for cliend-side form Validation befor submitting data to the server 
helps improve user experience by providing instant feedback on input errors
// Example of simple form validation
function validateForm() {
    var email = document.getElementById('email').value;
    if (!email.includes('@')) {
        alert('Invalid email address');
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}


Dynamic Content Updates 
allows developer to update content dynamically based on user interactions, preferences or data changes
can include rendering of data, creating interactive charts and more

Frameworks and libraries 
has a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, such as React, angular that simplify and streamline the development of complex web application 
tools provide components, state management, and other features to enhance productivity

-the purpose of AJAX in web development
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
set of web develpoment techniques used to create Asynchronous web application 
purpose = to enable the exchange of data between a web browser and a web server asynchronously, without requiring  a full page reload
leads to more dynamic and responsive user experience 

key purpose and benefits of using AJAX in web development 

Asynchronous Communication 
allows web page to send and receive data to/from a web server Asynchronous in the background without blocking the main user interface
ther operations on the page can continue while data is being fetched or sent to the server.

Improved User Experience 
developers can create web applications that feel more responsive and interactive. 
perform actions on a page, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, without experiencing a full page refresh.
results in a smoother and more seamless user experience.

Reduced Server load
enables developers to update only specific parts of a web page, rather than reloading the entire page.
reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and the server, leading to decreased server load and improved overall performance.

Dynamic Content Loading 
commonly used to load dynamic content on a web page without requiring a complete reload. 
For example, a news website might use AJAX to fetch and display the latest news articles as the user scrolls down the page, enhancing the site's interactivity.

Form Validation and Submission 
allows for client-side form validation and submission, providing instant feedback to users without reloading the entire page.
improves the user experience by reducing the time taken for form submissions.

Auto-completion and Suggestion
utilized to implement features like auto-completion and suggestions in search bars or input fields
AJAX requests can fetch relevant data from the server and display suggestions in real-time.

Interactive User Interface 
nstrumental in creating interactive user interfaces by enabling the update of content dynamically based on user interactions.
Elements like pop-up windows, modals, and real-time notifications can be implemented seamlessly.

-single-page Application(SPA)
AJAX is a key technology for building single-page applications, where a significant portion of the application's functionality is loaded dynamically as the user interacts with the page
aim to provide a more fluid and responsive user experience by loading and updating content asynchronously as the user interacts with the application.

Characteristics
Dynamic Loading 
load a single HTML page initially and dynamically update the content as needed. 
The initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are loaded once, and subsequent updates are fetched and applied as the user interacts with the application.

Client-Side Routing
SPAs typically use client-side routing to handle navigation without triggering full-page reloads.]
The application's JavaScript dynamically updates the content based on the URL, allowing users to navigate between different views or sections seamlessly.

Smooth Transistion 
SPAs often incorporate smooth transitions and animations between different views, enhancing the user experience and giving the application a more polished feel.

Asynchronous Communication:

SPAs leverage AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or other asynchronous techniques to communicate with the server in the background. 
This allows the application to fetch data and update the UI without requiring a complete page reload.

State Management:

SPAs maintain a client-side state to keep track of the current state of the application.
 This state is often managed using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, and it allows the application to remember user interactions and respond accordingly.

Improved Performance:
By reducing the need for full-page reloads, SPAs can provide a faster and more responsive user experience.
 Once the initial resources are loaded, subsequent interactions typically involve fetching smaller amounts of data, leading to quicker updates


-load balancer in a web system architecture
A load balancer is a crucial component in a web system architecture designed to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
 The primary goal of a load balancer is to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and ensure 
 the availability and reliability of a web application or service.

-working of the image tag with an example 
The Html <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page 
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image 

img tag has two required attributes:
src - Specifies tha path to the image  
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image 

syntax
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
